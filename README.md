### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
- Test components, utility functions, and API integration to catch bugs and regressions early in the development process.

### Validation and Error Handling
- Implement form validation to ensure data integrity and user input correctness.
- Handle errors gracefully with informative error messages and user-friendly error handling mechanisms.
